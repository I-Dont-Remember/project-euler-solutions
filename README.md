# Project Euler Solutions
Good practice for both rusty math skills and getting better with basic programming

## Important takeaway for myself
While brute-force solutions usually perform terribly, in real world situations the
speed with which they can be created offsets it's performance.  For tasks that aren't mission critical
needing upmost speed, the difference between running in 2 seconds vs 20 seconds is the developer grabbing a kleenex.
Humans move so slowly compared to the machines we use, especially as they get faster and able to 
hold more, the inefficiencies in our code get amortized by our slow response.


### Notes
- Repo setup will be heavily influenced by https://github.com/nayuki/Project-Euler-solutions/,
  his Python test of all solutions with answers seems like a good setup for a repo like this.

- Also this https://github.com/fabiomcosta/euler

- Eventually I will move on from using Project Euler for C practice and switch to a scripting
  language for reasons that I can't say better than this S.O. post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1991175/how-to-code-a-solution-to-deal-with-large-numbers#1991217
