# Project Euler Solutions
Good practice for both rusty math skills and getting better with basic programming

- Repo setup will be heavily influenced by https://github.com/nayuki/Project-Euler-solutions/,
  his Python test of all solutions with answers seems like a good setup for a repo like this.

- Also this https://github.com/fabiomcosta/euler

- Eventually I will move on from using Project Euler for C practice and switch to a scripting
  language for reasons that I can't say better than this S.O. post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1991175/how-to-code-a-solution-to-deal-with-large-numbers#1991217
